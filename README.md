# Personal Website 

Updated infrequently



## How it works 

Using the Hugo template and generation tool, you simply add content in the form of markdown files in the **content** section of the repo. The theme and overall configurations are handled using the **config.toml** file. 


## Testing 

1. Install and setup hugo by following [this](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
2. run ```hugo server``` and open the hosted local website
