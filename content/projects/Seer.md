 ## Have you ever tried to predict the future?

 Because I have figured out a way to do it 50% of the time.

 **Magic**? :sob: no its simply **Math**, with a generous bit of luck. There is a saying in the stock market, 
 >"Past performance does not predict future performance" - probably good advice

  However I always questioned that. And since I have no real money to lose with this project, I think I am in the clear for this.
