I am a student with a hunger to learn about all new things in embedded systems
and computers! I have a strong fundamental understanding of data structures and
algorithms in multiple languages such as C/C++, Python, Javascript and more. 

My current obsession: figuring out the blockchain and why it is not a Ponzi
scheme? 

Currently seeking Summer 2023 internships! I will be more than happy to connect with you and discuss more about any software engineering opportunities.
